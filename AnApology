If your reading this, im probably gone.. Or left my house in search for a happier life. its just.. my life has been kinda terrible lately.

Ill describe additional details i've not said. 
My name is [[REDACTED]].
Im 13. 
Currently living in a house with my mom and dad and my second dog.

My Dad Drinks Wine every day and is drunk. 
he often calls me or my mom taunting names.
he thinks i cant try hard enough even though i'm trying my best.
he currently owns a spa, soon to own an resturant too. ill be leaving this house within 5, 10 days. or never.
depending on my father's actions. He always insults me whenever i accidently answer incorrectly to one of his questions.
Even the tiniest mistakes end up getting me hurt or something else, 
he pushes me to my literal limits where even i start crying. he always sets the speed to 10 whenever im doing my treadmill exercise. 
he even killed my dog one time. and the worst part. i cant stay productive. i just..
feel lazy all of the sudden. i cant help it. i've got beaten up so many times for this.
but i cant stop. its all because of the virus..
we used to have offline classes and i felt so happy. i always thought what would happen every next class. we even did some arts and crafts
i would show to my parents. but in 2020.. it just went downhill. well. i have only a few things to say. 
i just want a spark of happiness and light on my final moments. but if i cant.. get myself to do it.. then this nightmare for me will never end. thank you for taking your time to read.

If i cant be happy. who else can?

Thank you.
